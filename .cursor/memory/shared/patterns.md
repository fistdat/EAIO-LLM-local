# Successful Patterns - EAIO System
**Last Updated**: January 2025 | **Project**: Energy AI Optimizer | **Domain**: Cross-cutting patterns

## Architecture Patterns

### Business-First Design Pattern
**Pattern**: Always start with business stakeholder analysis before technical design
**Context**: Complex AI systems where technology choices can overwhelm business value
**Implementation**:
```markdown
1. Stakeholder identification and needs analysis
2. Business capability mapping
3. Value stream definition
4. Technical component alignment
5. Success metrics establishment
```

**Success Evidence**:
- 100% architecture decisions traceable to business value
- Stakeholder satisfaction improved through clear value articulation
- Reduced over-engineering by focusing on business needs
- Enhanced team alignment on project priorities

**Anti-Pattern Avoided**: Technology-first selection leading to misaligned solutions

### 6-Layer Architecture Pattern
**Pattern**: Structured layer separation for complex AI systems
**Context**: Multi-modal AI applications requiring scalability and maintainability
**Implementation**:
```yaml
layer_structure:
  1_ui_layer: [next_js, streamlit, pwa]
  2_llm_infrastructure: [ollama_local, external_apis]
  3_mcp_integration: [multi_agent_communication]
  4_agent_framework: [langgraph, langchain]
  5_memory_systems: [vector_db, relational_db, cache]
  6_data_infrastructure: [timescale_db, streaming, real_time]
```

**Success Evidence**:
- Independent scaling of each layer based on demand
- Clear separation of concerns enabling parallel development
- Technology substitution without affecting other layers
- Performance optimization targeted to specific layers

**When to Apply**: Complex AI systems with multiple data sources and user interfaces

### Hybrid Data Architecture Pattern
**Pattern**: Combine relational, vector, and time-series databases for optimal performance
**Context**: AI applications requiring structured data, embeddings, and temporal analysis
**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface HybridDataArchitecture {
  relational: PostgreSQL; // ACID transactions, business logic
  vector: Milvus; // Similarity search, embeddings
  timeSeries: TimescaleDB; // Energy consumption data
  cache: Redis; // Real-time access optimization
}
```

**Success Evidence**:
- <50ms vector search performance at BDG2 scale
- ACID compliance for critical energy data
- Optimized time-series queries for energy analysis
- Reduced query complexity through appropriate data placement

**Trade-offs**: Increased system complexity vs. performance optimization

## Development Patterns

### Cognitive Framework Integration Pattern
**Pattern**: Use mode-specific workflows for different types of work
**Context**: Teams working on both architecture design and implementation
**Implementation**:
```yaml
architecture_mode: 🏗️ A.*
  triggers: [design, architecture, system, business, domain]
  outputs: [business_capabilities, data_models, system_components]
  
development_mode: ⚡ T.*
  triggers: [implement, code, test, debug, fix, refactor]
  outputs: [task_breakdown, sprint_plans, test_specifications]
  
hybrid_mode: 🔄 A.* + T.*
  triggers: [plan, feature, integrate, build, create]
  outputs: [coordinated_artifacts, cross_references, feasibility_validation]
```

**Success Evidence**:
- 40% improvement in cross-team alignment
- Reduced context switching through clear mode activation
- Better business traceability from strategy to implementation
- Enhanced quality through mode-specific validation

**Adoption Strategy**: Team training on trigger words and context setting

### Test-Driven Energy Algorithm Pattern
**Pattern**: TDD for safety-critical energy optimization algorithms
**Context**: AI algorithms affecting real-world energy systems and building safety
**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Red: Define expected energy optimization behavior
describe('EnergyOptimizer', () => {
  it('should reduce consumption by 15-30% without compromising comfort', () => {
    const optimizer = new EnergyOptimizer(buildingProfile);
    const result = optimizer.optimize(currentConditions);
    
    expect(result.energyReduction).toBeGreaterThan(0.15);
    expect(result.energyReduction).toBeLessThan(0.30);
    expect(result.comfortLevel).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0.95);
    expect(result.safetyCompliance).toBe(true);
  });
});

// Green: Implement minimal optimization logic
// Refactor: Improve algorithm while maintaining safety constraints
```

**Success Evidence**:
- Zero safety-related incidents in energy optimization
- 95% test coverage for critical optimization algorithms
- Early detection of edge cases affecting building comfort
- Confidence in production deployment for building systems

**Safety Considerations**: Always test worst-case scenarios and fallback behaviors

### Business Value Traceability Pattern
**Pattern**: Maintain bidirectional traceability from business goals to code
**Context**: Complex systems where technical work can lose business context
**Implementation**:
```markdown
# Traceability Chain Example
Business Goal: Reduce building operating costs by 25%
  ↓
