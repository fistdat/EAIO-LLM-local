### Memory Access Patterns

#### Query-Driven Access
```typescript
// Example memory queries during cognitive framework usage

// Architecture Mode Query
interface ArchitectureMemoryQuery {
  context: "designing microservices architecture for energy optimization";
  needed_information: [
    "proven_microservices_patterns_for_AI_systems",
    "scalability_decisions_for_building_portfolio_growth", 
    "integration_patterns_for_building_management_systems"
  ];
  memory_sources: ["architecture/pattern_catalog.md", "shared/decisions.md"];
}

// Development Mode Query  
interface DevelopmentMemoryQuery {
  context: "implementing TDD for energy optimization algorithms";
  needed_information: [
    "testing_patterns_for_safety_critical_systems",
    "performance_testing_strategies_for_real_time_optimization",
    "quality_gates_for_AI_algorithm_development"
  ];
  memory_sources: ["development/test_strategies.md", "shared/patterns.md"];
}

// Hybrid Mode Query
interface HybridMemoryQuery {
  context: "coordinating architecture design with implementation planning";
  needed_information: [
    "feasibility_validation_patterns",
    "architecture_to_implementation_traceability",
    "cross_team_coordination_strategies"
  ];
  memory_sources: ["all_memory_files"];
}
```

#### Update-Driven Maintenance
```typescript
// Example memory updates during project execution

interface MemoryUpdate {
  trigger: ProjectMilestone | ProblemSolution | PatternDiscovery;
  target_files: string[];
  update_type: "addition" | "modification" | "deprecation";
  business_impact: string;
  technical_impact: string;
}

// Example updates
const memoryUpdates: MemoryUpdate[] = [
  {
    trigger: "discovered_new_optimization_algorithm_pattern",
    target_files: ["development/code_patterns.md", "shared/patterns.md"],
    update_type: "addition",
    business_impact: "15% improvement in energy optimization effectiveness",
    technical_impact: "reduced computational complexity for real-time processing"
  },
  {
    trigger: "architecture_decision_about_database_scaling",
    target_files: ["architecture/design_rationale.md", "shared/decisions.md"],
    update_type: "addition", 
    business_impact: "supports growth to 10x building portfolio size",
    technical_impact: "horizontal scaling strategy with acceptable performance"
  }
];
```
