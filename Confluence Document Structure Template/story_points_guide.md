## ‚è∞ MAN-DAY ESTIMATION

### üìÖ Man-day Definition

**Man-day** = Amount of work that can be done by one person in one working day

**Characteristics:**
- **Absolute time measurement**
- **Resource-based calculation**
- **Calendar dependency**
- **Individual productivity variation**

### üîÑ Man-day Calculation Methods

#### **Method 1: Bottom-up Estimation**
```yaml
Process:
1. Break down story into detailed tasks
2. Estimate each task in hours
3. Sum up total hours
4. Convert to man-days (√∑ 8 hours)

Example - User Registration Story:
Tasks:
  - Design database schema: 2 hours
  - Create registration form: 4 hours
  - Implement validation logic: 3 hours
  - Add email confirmation: 4 hours
  - Write unit tests: 3 hours
  - Integration testing: 2 hours
  - Documentation: 1 hour

Total: 19 hours = 2.4 man-days
```

#### **Method 2: Analogous Estimation**
```yaml
Process:
1. Find similar completed stories
2. Adjust for differences
3. Apply complexity multipliers
4. Account for team experience

Example:
Base story: "User login" = 1.5 man-days
Current story: "User registration" 
Adjustment: +30% (more complex)
Result: 1.5 √ó 1.3 = 1.95 man-days
```

#### **Method 3: Three-point Estimation**
```yaml
Process:
1. Estimate optimistic time (O)
2. Estimate most likely time (M)  
3. Estimate pessimistic time (P)
4. Calculate: (O + 4M + P) √∑ 6

Example - Payment Integration:
Optimistic: 3 days
Most Likely: 5 days
Pessimistic: 10 days
PERT Estimate: (3 + 4√ó5 + 10) √∑ 6 = 5.5 days
```

## üîÑ CONVERSION BETWEEN STORY POINTS AND MAN-DAY

### üìà Velocity-based Conversion

#### **Team Velocity Calculation**
```yaml
Step 1: Track Completed Story Points per Sprint
Sprint 1: 23 points completed
Sprint 2: 27 points completed  
Sprint 3: 25 points completed
Sprint 4: 29 points completed

Step 2: Calculate Average Velocity
Average Velocity = (23 + 27 + 25 + 29) √∑ 4 = 26 points/sprint

Step 3: Calculate Team Capacity
Team: 5 developers √ó 10 days/sprint = 50 man-days/sprint

Step 4: Calculate Conversion Rate
Conversion Rate = 50 man-days √∑ 26 points = 1.92 man-days/point
```

#### **Conversion Formula**
```
Man-days = Story Points √ó (Team Man-days per Sprint √∑ Team Velocity)

Example:
8 Story Points √ó (50 man-days √∑ 26 velocity) = 15.4 man-days
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Conversion Limitations

#### **Why Conversion is Problematic:**
```yaml
Different Dimensions:
  - Story Points: Complexity-based
  - Man-days: Time-based
  - Not linear relationship

Team Variations:
  - Different teams = different velocities
  - Same story ‚â† same time for different teams
  - Skill level impacts significantly

Context Dependency:
  - Sprint capacity varies
  - External factors affect velocity
  - Learning curve changes over time

Velocity Evolution:
  - Team improves over time
  - New team members impact velocity
  - Technology changes affect productivity
```

#### **Safe Conversion Practices:**
```yaml
Use for Planning Only:
  - High-level estimates
  - Budget forecasting
  - Resource planning
  - Timeline approximation

Avoid for Commitment:
  - Don't commit exact dates
  - Don't measure individual performance
  - Don't use for contract terms
  - Don't compare teams

Regular Recalibration:
  - Update conversion quarterly
  - Account for team changes
  - Adjust for technology shifts
  - Consider external factors
```

### ‚úÖ Story Points Best Practices

#### **Estimation Process:**
```yaml
Before Estimation:
  - Ensure story is well-defined
  - Identify all acceptance criteria
  - Clarify technical approach
  - Discuss potential risks

During Estimation:

Do:
  - Keep story points stable over time
  - Include all work needed to complete story
  - Re-estimate if requirements change significantly
  - Use historical data for planning
  - Focus on team improvement, not individual productivity
```
